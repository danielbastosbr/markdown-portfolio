I always was obese, and when I was 40, everything became worse. 

I hitted **_116 kgs_** the maximum in all my life, then I decide to change my whole life and look for a new lifestyle, healthier and active.

**Today** my weight is 86.4 kilograms, and going down.

My plan now is improve my skill as *I improved my health*.
